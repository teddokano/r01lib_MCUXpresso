# r01lib_MCUXpresso

## What is this?

The `r01lib_MCUXpresso` is a sample/test projects for [r01lib](https://github.com/teddokano/r01lib).  
`r01lib` is a source code package for class libraries to abstract MCUs and peripheral devices.
From application code, GPIO, IÂ²C, I3C, SPI, Pin-interrupt and timer (ticker) can be accessed with simple APIs.

The `r01lib` is a submodule of this repository.  
In this `r01lib_MCUXpresso` repository there are several projects in same workspace and some of those project named as `_r01lib_*`. 
Those are library projects which cannot run standalone but those are linked from application projects.  

All projects can be imported/build/execute on MCUXpresso IDE. 

### Samples
The code can be written like next sample.  
The API are in Arm-Mbed style.  
`#include	"r01lib.h"` includes `"stdio.h"` to enable calling `printf()` function. 

```cpp
// Sample code in app_template_FRDM_MCX* project

#include	"r01lib.h"

DigitalOut	led( BLUE );

int main( void )
{
	printf( "Hello, world!\r\n" );

	led	= true;

	while ( true )
	{
		led	= !led;
		wait( 0.5 );
	}
}
```

Since the projects are written in C++, `std::cout` can be used also.  
However, this cannot be used on FRDM-MCXA153 because it flash memory size limication.  

```cpp
// Sample code in z_r01lib_demo_Hello_world_FRDM_MCX* project

#include	"r01lib.h"

int main( void )
{
	printf( "Hello, world! (in C style)\r\n" );
	std::cout << "Hello, world! (in C++ style)" << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```
